Adams's contribution to UK radio is commemorated in The Radio Academy's Hall of Fame.[2]\n\nAdams also wrote Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency (1987) and The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul (1988), and co-wrote The Meaning of Liff (1983), The Deeper Meaning of Liff (1990), and Last Chance to See (1990).

A posthumous collection of his selected works, including the first publication of his final (unfinished) novel, was published as The Salmon of Doubt in 2002.\n\nAdams was an advocate for environmentalism and conservation, a lover of fast cars,[3] technological innovation and the Apple Macintosh, and a self-proclaimed \"radical atheist\".",
